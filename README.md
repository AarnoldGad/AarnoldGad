🪐 French astronomer, studying in Sweden,<br/>
I believe in a world where code can be both efficient and expressive.

☕ I develop mainly in C++, but also in Python and Fortran. <br/> 
I like low level, electronic, and consuming too much caffeine.

🖥 I spend my free time working on my own utility library and game engine, <br/>
learning shader development and computer graphics techniques.
